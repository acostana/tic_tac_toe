#tic_tac_toe

Explanation: This program allows the user to play tic tac toe against the computer. The user inputs numbers to select a box on the board and the computer does too. Prints the updated board each time and also prints each board to a file each time the board is updated.

How to run the program: After the files Symbol.java and TicTacToe.java have been downloaded, compile TicTacToe and run it. Enter inputs as you are asked to.

Known bugs/errors/unexpected outputs: 
-When prompted for a number and a number that is not on the list provided and has never been, no error is given but it just doesn’t do anything, it doesn’t print anything as if the user had not entered anything and proceeds to choose the computer’s input.
-If a number that is not on the list because it was already selected is selected it gives an error
-Entering something other than a number when the program asks user for a number causes an error
-When prompted if they want to play again if user enters something other than y or n it takes it as a no("n") and exits program
